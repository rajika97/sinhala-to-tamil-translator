# **Sinhala-Tamil Neural Machine Translation Using Pivot-Based Transfer Learning**
This Colab notebook demonstrates a proof of concept for a neural machine translation system between Sinhala and Tamil, using English as a pivot language. I will use the mBART model and AdapterFusion to fine-tune the model for low-resource language pairs.
